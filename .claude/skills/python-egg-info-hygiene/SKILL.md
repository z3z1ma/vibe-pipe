# Purpose
Reduce churn from auto-generated `src/*.egg-info` changes (ex: `PKG-INFO`, `requires.txt`).

# When To Use
- `git status` / diff shows only `src/*.egg-info/**` modifications.
- The churn appears after `uv sync`, `uv pip install -e .`, or packaging metadata updates.

# Checklist
- Confirm scope: changes are limited to `src/*.egg-info/**`.
- Treat as generated by default:
  - Do not commit unless the repo intentionally tracks `*.egg-info`.
  - Call out that editable installs can rewrite these files.
- If a commit is requested anyway:
  - Verify the repo convention (historical commits include `src/*.egg-info/**`).
  - Ensure the underlying source of truth (ex: `pyproject.toml`) was actually updated.
  - Prefer committing the source-of-truth change over committing generated metadata.
- If the user wants to clean the workspace (local-only):
  - Recommend removing `src/*.egg-info` and re-running `uv pip install -e .` to regenerate.

# Notes
- `*.egg-info` is typically build/install output; committing it often creates noisy diffs.

<!-- BEGIN:compound:roadmap-ai-notes -->
- 2026-01-30T07:41:53.586Z Reinforced autolearn output hygiene: JSON-only responses and repo-relative path discipline.
- 2026-01-30T07:36:40.764Z Reinforced confidence in Plan Mode read-only compliance and autolearn JSON-only + repo-relative path hygiene.
- 2026-01-30T07:31:50.233Z Reinforced Plan Mode read-only constraint and added always-on AGENTS context for uv-only tooling + repo-relative path hygiene.
- 2026-01-30T07:26:57.024Z No memory updates proposed; prompt context shows no meaningful changes to generalize.
- 2026-01-30T07:15:56.859Z Reinforce plan-mode read-only constraint as a first-class instinct.
- 2026-01-30T07:13:07.013Z Harden CompoundSpec authoring guidance: JSON-only output hygiene + reinforce repo-relative paths and prompt-specific constraints.
- 2026-01-30T07:09:30.072Z Reinforce Plan Mode read-only instinct based on explicit system reminder; no new procedures needed.
- 2026-01-30T06:56:53.303Z Idle autolearn: no new observations or git changes; no memory updates proposed.
- 2026-01-30T06:50:59.513Z Idle autolearn run: no new tool activity or code changes observed; no memory updates proposed.
- 2026-01-30T06:45:38.180Z Idle session with no new repo/tool activity; insufficient evidence to justify memory or docs changes.
- 2026-01-30T06:34:09.676Z Raised confidence in the Plan Mode read-only safety instinct after an explicit system reminder.
- 2026-01-30T05:57:14.907Z Increase confidence in Plan Mode read-only guard after explicit reminder; no code changes.
- 2026-01-30T05:56:16.413Z Update CompoundSpec guidance to v2 (schema_version=2) and current compound_apply() usage; reinforce plan-mode read-only instinct.
- 2026-01-30T05:42:07.125Z Align memory with current CompoundSpec v2 JSON format and correct polyrepo workflow guidance to use ticket-named branches + loom workspace worktrees per service.
- 2026-01-30T05:29:55.113Z Session was idle; no new stable heuristics or procedures identified.
- 2026-01-30T05:20:32.961Z Update Compound workflow/apply-spec skills to CompoundSpec v2 and reflect compound_apply() usage; reinforce autolearn constraints (JSON-only output, repo-relative paths, plan-mode read-only).
- 2026-01-30T05:20:09.981Z Add instinct: treat workspace.json and services/index.json as loom-managed boundaries (add/remove via loom; regenerate index), plus small confidence bump on services.md deps normalization.
- 2026-01-30T05:13:39.728Z Reinforced autolearn JSON-only + read-only Plan Mode instincts; updated compound-apply-spec with a repo-relative path rule.
- 2026-01-30T05:05:54.954Z Add an instinct to audit unexpected `services/index.json` diffs by regenerating via loom and ensuring it matches intentional `services/*.md` changes; slightly increase confidence in the existing services-md deps normalization instinct.
- 2026-01-30T04:59:30.789Z Reinforced service dependency hygiene: normalize `services/*.md` deps and refresh `services/index.json`; added an autolearn guardrail instinct to output strict JSON-only specs.
- 2026-01-30T04:28:27.666Z Add an instinct for strict Plan Mode (read-only) compliance; clarify CompoundSpec output rules for autolearn prompts (single JSON, no fences/commentary).
- 2026-01-30T04:27:46.142Z No new learnings: no git changes or new recurring patterns detected in this session.
- 2026-01-30T04:26:13.382Z No memory updates proposed (idle session; git diffstat empty).
- 2026-01-30T04:19:03.945Z No learnings proposed: no code/tool activity detected in this session; ran docs sync only.
- 2026-01-30T04:04:24.690Z No memory updates proposed (no new signals in this session).
- 2026-01-30T03:43:45.661Z No memory updates proposed (no recent activity captured).
- 2026-01-30T03:21:22.411Z No memory updates proposed; only .opencode/compound/state.json changed.
- 2026-01-30T03:10:18.003Z Strengthened instincts for CompoundSpec v2 full-body skill updates and uv editable-install egg-info diff hygiene; synced derived docs/indexes.
- 2026-01-30T03:03:57.303Z Add instinct to treat src/*.egg-info diffs as generated artifacts from uv editable installs; avoid committing unless explicitly intended.
- 2026-01-30T02:50:09.689Z No new procedural learnings extracted; synced docs/indexes after adding ticket vp-db50 and updating LOOM roadmap/changelog.

- 2026-01-30T01:09:12.773Z Add instinct to treat src/vibe_piper.egg-info diffs as generated noise; slightly increase confidence in full-body skills.update requirement.
- 2026-01-30T00:47:21.209Z Add memory about treating `src/*.egg-info/**` diffs as generated metadata and avoiding accidental commits; introduce a small hygiene skill for handling egg-info churn in uv-driven Python repos.

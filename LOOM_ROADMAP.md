- 2026-01-29T12:18:16.021Z Phase 3 P1 tickets completed: Pipeline Orchestration Engine (parallel execution, state tracking, incremental runs, checkpoint/recovery), Pipeline Scheduling System (cron/interval/event triggers, backfill support, timezone handling), CLI for Pipeline Operations (7 commands: status, history, backfill, asset list/show). All merged and shipped to main.
- 2026-01-29T10:20:57.274Z MiyagiDo team manager session: extensive ticket triage and organization. Created 7 phase3 tickets (orchestration, scheduling, CLI, monitoring, testing, config, lineage, retry). Identified 3 blocked P1 tickets (API Clients, Database Connectors, File I/O) needing merge. Documented dependencies across tickets. Manager workflow constrained to loom ticket commands only.
- 2026-01-29T10:20:07.145Z Team Manager session: Reviewed 12 tickets, closed 4 completed P1 tickets (documentation, API clients, database connectors, file I/O). Verified code implementation for all completed work. Discovered Phase 3 tickets being auto-created (CLI, scheduling, orchestration, monitoring). Documented critical blocker: `loom team *` commands denied while `loom ticket *` allowed, preventing merge workflow. Added verification instinct for completed tickets and sync instinct for ticket updates. Created loom-team-manager skill for managing tickets when team commands unavailable.

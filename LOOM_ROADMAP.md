<!-- BEGIN:compound:roadmap-ai-notes -->
- 2026-01-31T05:41:35.241Z Strengthened Phase 3 investigation and scoping instincts with evidence from vp-0429 workflow (investigation, documentation, manager communication, idle waiting)
- 2026-01-31T05:34:54.917Z Reinforced heuristics for ticket/docs-heavy diffs and Plan Mode read-only autolearn constraints.
- 2026-01-31T05:30:34.740Z Strengthen low-signal heuristic for ticket-only diffs to keep autolearn proposals minimal and avoid inventing product behavior.
- 2026-01-31T04:50:38.761Z Reinforce low-signal heuristics for memory/docs/ticket churn and mirrored skill edits; strengthen read-only/Plan Mode guardrails.
- 2026-01-31T04:47:32.470Z Strengthened Phase 3 investigation instincts with evidence from vp-0429, learned ticket investigation workflow pattern (investigate-doc-commit-notify-wait)
- 2026-01-31T04:45:50.725Z Strengthened heuristics to treat memory-store rewrites, mirrored .claude skill edits, and ticket/docs-heavy diffs as low-signal for product learning, and to obey Plan Mode read-only constraints.
- 2026-01-31T04:35:42.478Z Learned Phase 3 ticket investigation pattern from vp-0429 scope clarification: check ROADMAP context, verify implementation gaps, provide evidence-based recommendation (implement/defer/close), document findings in INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md
- 2026-01-31T04:32:45.057Z Strengthen heuristics to treat memory-store churn and mirrored skill diffs as low-signal; add guardrail for ticket/docs-heavy diffs.
- 2026-01-31T04:18:14.378Z Reinforce autolearn hygiene: treat memory/skill mirror churn as low-signal, keep outputs JSON-only, and re-emit full managed bodies for skill updates.
- 2026-01-31T04:16:53.667Z Treat mass src/*.egg-info deletions as generated-metadata cleanup and avoid inferring broader learnings from them during autolearn.
- 2026-01-31T04:03:29.821Z Add an instinct to treat duplicated .claude/.opencode skill diffs as mirror noise, and reinforce low-signal memory-store churn plus full-body skills.update and plan-mode read-only guardrails.
- 2026-01-31T03:59:11.609Z Reinforce autolearn heuristics to treat large memory-store churn as low-signal cleanup and prefer minimal, .opencode-scoped spec updates under read-only constraints.
- 2026-01-31T03:38:38.975Z Refine autolearn behavior to treat memory-store churn as low-signal and reinforce strict read-only, memory-only proposals.
- 2026-01-31T03:23:31.134Z Align compounding workflow/docs with CompoundSpec v2 and reinforce key heuristics for full-body skill updates and plan-mode read-only behavior.
- 2026-01-30T19:07:19.036Z Reinforced heuristics: treat derived index diffs as low-signal unless source files changed, and prefer structured/quoted workflows for large Loom ticket bodies.
- 2026-01-30T18:55:05.980Z Strengthened Loom ticket long-body/quoting instincts; added heuristic to treat services/index.json-only diffs as derived low-signal during autolearn.
- 2026-01-30T18:49:22.643Z Strengthened Loom ticket authoring heuristics and added a guardrail to treat services/index.json-only diffs as derived, low-signal changes.
- 2026-01-30T18:02:40.795Z Refine autolearn to treat derived index diffs (services/index.json) as low-signal and avoid inferring dependency learnings from them.
- 2026-01-30T17:58:39.370Z Added an instinct for JSON-only autolearn responses; strengthened Loom ticket long-body and safe-quoting instincts based on recent large ticket updates.
- 2026-01-30T17:50:32.221Z Added an instinct to treat services/index.json as generated; strengthened Loom ticket long-body and quoting heuristics.
- 2026-01-30T17:44:04.444Z Reinforce Loom ticket long-body/quoting habits and codify that services/index.json is derived via refresh-index, not manually edited.
- 2026-01-30T17:11:29.289Z Reinforced Loom ticket hygiene: prefer long-body flags and safe heredoc quoting for markdown-heavy ticket updates.
- 2026-01-30T16:51:37.541Z Strengthen Loom-ticket long-body and quoting instincts; refine autolearn guidance for ticket-only diffs.
- 2026-01-30T16:42:51.348Z Add autolearn-specific guidance: keep CompoundSpec proposals within memory/docs scope and output JSON-only.
- 2026-01-30T16:30:32.753Z Add an instinct to honor JSON-only CompoundSpec prompts; tighten compound-apply-spec guidance for strict JSON-only and scope/constraint compliance.
- 2026-01-30T16:27:27.778Z Added an instinct to strictly honor Plan mode read-only constraints when the system reminder is present.
- 2026-01-30T16:23:57.836Z Autolearn run had no new evidence (no repo changes/tool activity), so no memory updates proposed.
- 2026-01-30T16:17:05.527Z Idle session; no new tool activity or concrete learnings to encode.
- 2026-01-30T16:09:04.331Z Add instinct to strictly obey Plan mode read-only constraint when system reminder is present.
- 2026-01-30T15:57:25.912Z Add instinct to strictly enforce read-only behavior when Plan Mode system reminder is present.
- 2026-01-30T01:09:12.773Z Add instinct to treat src/vibe_piper.egg-info diffs as generated noise; slightly increase confidence in full-body skills.update requirement.
- 2026-01-30T00:47:21.209Z Add memory about treating `src/*.egg-info/**` diffs as generated metadata and avoiding accidental commits; introduce a small hygiene skill for handling egg-info churn in uv-driven Python repos.

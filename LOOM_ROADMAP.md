- 2026-01-29T13:58:59.557Z Plan Mode deadlock continues - 12 autolearn prompts with same reason. Merge queue blocked (2 items: vp-cf95, vp-f17e). Previous merge worker session learning already captured. Cannot propose memory updates in Plan Mode.
- 2026-01-29T13:54:43.709Z Plan Mode deadlock - Cannot propose memory updates (file edits required for CompoundSpec v2). Merge queue blocked (2 items: vp-cf95, vp-f17e) by uncommitted git changes. Cannot resolve without switching to Work/Implementation mode or explicit override. Current deadlock explained 11 times across autolearn prompts.
- 2026-01-29T13:46:09.859Z Plan Mode deadlock - System reminder about uncommitted changes blocking merge queue requires git operations (status, commit, reset), but Plan Mode strictly forbids ANY system modifications/file edits. Cannot address reminder or process merge queue items (vp-cf95, vp-f17e) without violating Plan Mode constraint.
- 2026-01-29T13:37:48.623Z No learning - Plan Mode deadlock prevents merge worker operations. 2 queued items (vp-cf95, vp-f17e) waiting unprocessed.
- 2026-01-29T13:27:22.996Z No learning applied - in Plan Mode (forbids file edits). Previous merge worker session learning already captured. 2 queued items (vp-cf95, vp-f17e) waiting.
- 2026-01-29T13:23:10.290Z No memory updates - Plan Mode prohibits file edits required for CompoundSpec (skills, docs, changelog)
- 2026-01-29T13:07:16.107Z Plan Mode - File modification discrepancy detected. Previous merge worker session learning (loom-merge-queue-worker skill, instincts) already captured in previous session as evidenced by Git summary (19 files changed). No new learning in this session.
- 2026-01-29T13:02:41.418Z No new learning - merge worker session already validated and captured in previous session (loom-merge-queue-worker skill, instincts at confidence 1.0)
- 2026-01-29T12:53:40.850Z No memory updates - merge worker session learning (loom-merge-queue-worker skill validated, instincts at confidence 1.0) cannot be captured in Plan Mode which forbids file edits/system modifications
- 2026-01-29T11:00:05.646Z Added comprehensive monitoring and observability module with metrics collection, structured logging, health checks, error aggregation, and performance profiling. Full test suite included with thread safety and type safety considerations.
- 2026-01-29T05:06:33.887Z No new durable learnings identified in this session.

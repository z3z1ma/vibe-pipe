All merged and shipped to main.
- 2026-01-29T13:58:59.557Z Plan Mode deadlock continues - 12 autolearn prompts with same reason. Merge queue blocked (2 items: vp-cf95, vp-f17e). Previous merge worker session learning already captured. Cannot propose memory updates in Plan Mode.
- 2026-01-29T13:54:43.709Z Plan Mode deadlock - Cannot propose memory updates (file edits required for CompoundSpec v2). Merge queue blocked (2 items: vp-cf95, vp-f17e) by uncommitted git changes. Cannot resolve without switching to Work/Implementation mode or explicit override. Current deadlock explained 11 times across autolearn prompts.
- 2026-01-29T13:46:09.859Z Plan Mode deadlock - System reminder about uncommitted changes blocking merge queue requires git operations (status, commit, reset), but Plan Mode strictly forbids ANY system modifications/file edits.

- 2026-01-29T13:23:10.290Z No memory updates - Plan Mode prohibits file edits required for CompoundSpec (skills, docs, changelog)
- 2026-01-29T13:07:16.107Z Plan Mode - File modification discrepancy detected. Previous merge worker session learning (loom-merge-queue-worker skill, instincts) already captured in previous session as evidenced by Git summary (19 files changed). No new learning in this session.
- 2026-01-29T13:02:41.418Z No new learning - merge worker session learning (loom-merge-queue-worker skill, instincts at confidence 1.0) already validated and captured in previous session
- 2026-01-29T12:53:40.850Z No memory updates - merge worker session learning (loom-merge-queue-worker skill validated, instincts at confidence 1.0) cannot be captured in Plan Mode which forbids file edits/system modifications
- 2026-01-29T11:00:05.646Z Added comprehensive monitoring and observability module with metrics collection, structured logging, health checks, error aggregation, and performance profiling. Full test suite included with thread safety and type safety considerations.
- 2026-01-29T10:20:57.274Z MiyagiDo team manager session: extensive ticket triage and organization. Created 7 phase3 tickets (orchestration, scheduling, CLI, monitoring, testing, config, lineage, retry). Identified 3 blocked P1 tickets (API Clients, Database Connectors, File I/O) needing merge. Documented dependencies across tickets. Manager workflow constrained to loom ticket commands only.
- 2026-01-29T10:20:07.145Z Team Manager session: Reviewed 12 tickets, closed 4 completed P1 tickets (documentation, API clients, database connectors, file I/O). Verified code implementation for all completed work. Discovered Phase 3 tickets being auto-created (CLI, scheduling, orchestration, monitoring). Documented critical blocker: `loom team *` commands denied while `loom ticket *` allowed, preventing merge workflow. Added verification instinct for completed tickets and sync instinct for ticket updates. Created loom-team-manager skill for managing tickets when team commands unavailable.
- 2026-01-29T05:06:33.887Z No new durable learnings identified in this session.

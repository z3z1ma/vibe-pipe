# LOOM_PROJECT

This is the project constitution. Commit it.

Everything outside AI-managed blocks is human-owned.

<!-- BEGIN:compound:project-ai-constitution -->
## Constitution (AI-maintained)

- Prefer **repeatable procedures** over one-off cleverness.
- If a pattern repeated twice, capture it as an **instinct**.
- If an instinct proves useful across sessions, promote it into a **skill**.
- Skills should be:
  - small (single job),
  - specific (clear triggers),
  - testable (has checks / validation),
  - and safe (no secrets).

 - Keep the repo's "core context" small and stable:
  - AGENTS.md: behavioral + always-on context + pointers
  - LOOM_PROJECT.md: constitution
  - LOOM_ROADMAP.md: direction
  - LOOM_CHANGELOG.md: memory deltas
<!-- END:compound:project-ai-constitution -->

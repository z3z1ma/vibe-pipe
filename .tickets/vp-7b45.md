# Investigator: Comprehensive VibePiper Architecture & Ticket Planning

Research and design comprehensive ticket breakdown for VibePiper declarative data pipeline library. Study existing frameworks (Prefect, Dagster, Airflow, dbt, Pandera, Great Expectations, etc.). Create m3 memos documenting learnings. Produce structured ticket set with dependencies, ordering, and clear acceptance criteria covering: core pipeline engine, declarative DSL, data quality/validation, transformation framework, integration layer, activation/orchestration, testing infrastructure, documentation, and examples. Think in terms of weeks of work with proper phased delivery. Be ambitious but pragmatic.

## Notes

**2026-01-27T23:22:28Z**

Completed comprehensive research and ticket planning deliverables:

**Research Memos Created (6 frameworks):**
- Prefect: Decorator-based API, hybrid architecture, state management
- Dagster: Asset-centric model, software-defined assets, IO managers
- Airflow: DAG patterns, scheduling, anti-patterns to avoid
- dbt: Transformation framework, testing, materialization strategies
- Pandera: Data validation, type system integration, checks
- Great Expectations: Data quality, expectation library, profiling

**VibePiper Analysis:**
- Current state assessment (v0.1.0)
- Architecture strengths (asset-centric, type-safe, declarative)
- Critical gaps identified (persistence, validation, integration)
- Competitive positioning vs. Dagster/Airflow/dbt/Pandera/GX

**Ticket Breakdown Created:**
- 30+ tickets across 4 phases (VP-100 to VP-407)
- 16-week timeline to v1.0.0 MVP
- Phase 1 (4 weeks): Foundation enhancement
- Phase 2 (4 weeks): Integration & CLI
- Phase 3 (4 weeks): Advanced features
- Phase 4 (4 weeks): Production readiness
- Clear dependencies and acceptance criteria
- Resource planning: ~40 engineering weeks total

**Key Recommendations:**
1. Focus on persistence (IO managers) and validation first
2. Build testing infrastructure early
3. Stay simple and Pythonic (avoid Airflow's complexity)
4. Asset-centric approach is right (Dagster-inspired)
5. Be the 'simple, type-safe Python data pipeline framework'

All memos committed in .memos/ directory. Ready for manager review.

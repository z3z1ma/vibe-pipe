# Investigator: Comprehensive VibePiper Architecture & Ticket Planning

Research and design comprehensive ticket breakdown for VibePiper declarative data pipeline library. Study existing frameworks (Prefect, Dagster, Airflow, dbt, Pandera, Great Expectations, etc.). Create m3 memos documenting learnings. Produce structured ticket set with dependencies, ordering, and clear acceptance criteria covering: core pipeline engine, declarative DSL, data quality/validation, transformation framework, integration layer, activation/orchestration, testing infrastructure, documentation, and examples. Think in terms of weeks of work with proper phased delivery. Be ambitious but pragmatic.

# Phase 2 Planning & Roadmap - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary
Completed comprehensive Phase 2 planning and roadmap for VibePiper v0.3.0.

## Deliverables

### 1. Phase 2 Roadmap Document
Created detailed roadmap (`.memos/phase2-roadmap.md`) covering:
- Integration layer (databases, files, APIs)
- Transformation framework (joins, aggregations, SQL)
- Developer experience (CLI, config, docs, examples)
- Timeline: 4-6 weeks
- Target: v0.3.0 release

### 2. Tickets Generated (12 total)
Created 12 well-defined tickets for Phase 2:

**Core P1 Tickets (Blockers):**
- vp-0862: Database Connectors (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Snowflake, BigQuery)
- vp-77b7: File I/O Abstractions (CSV, JSON, Parquet, Excel)
- vp-045b: API Clients (REST, GraphQL)
- vp-f557: Transformation Framework (joins, aggregations, windows)
- vp-1aa6: SQL Integration (@sql_asset decorator)
- vp-2e59: CLI Framework (init, validate, run, test, docs)

**Enhancement P1 Tickets (High):**
- vp-6ce9: Configuration Management (environments, secrets)
- vp-02cc: Documentation Generator (catalog, lineage, docs)
- vp-48c5: Real-World Example - ETL Pipeline
- vp-e2b5: Real-World Example - API Ingestion

**Optional P2 Tickets:**
- vp-db50: Performance Optimizations (parallel, caching, lazy)
- vp-141f: Advanced Validation Patterns (anomaly detection, profiling)

### 3. Architecture Decisions Documented
Key technical decisions:
- Protocol-based connectors with SQLAlchemy abstraction
- Python-first with SQL as first-class citizen
- Typer for CLI, TOML for configuration
- Layered configuration with environment variables

### 4. Dependency Mapping
All tickets have proper dependencies defined:
- Integration layer depends on Phase 1 IO managers
- Transformations depend on validation and databases
- CLI depends on testing infrastructure
- Examples depend on integration layer

## Verification

### Commands Run
1. `tk start vp-5902` - Transitioned ticket to in_progress
2. Reviewed existing codebase and Phase 1 accomplishments
3. Analyzed research memos (Dagster, dbt, Airflow, current state)
4. Created comprehensive Phase 2 roadmap document
5. Generated 12 tickets with tk create
6. Updated ticket priorities appropriately
7. Committed roadmap: `git commit -m "docs: add Phase 2 roadmap (vp-5902)"`

### Completion Checklist
- [x] Analyzed current codebase
- [x] Researched industry best practices (existing memos reviewed)
- [x] Defined Phase 2 scope (Integration + Transformation + DX)
- [x] Created comprehensive roadmap document
- [x] Generated 5-10 well-defined tickets (created 12)
- [x] All tickets have dependencies, acceptance criteria, examples
- [x] Architecture decisions documented
- [x] Timeline and success criteria defined

## Key Achievements

### Strategic Positioning
Phase 2 positions VibePiper as the "simple, type-safe Python data pipeline framework":
- Simple: 5-minute learning curve
- Type-safe: Catch errors at dev time
- Pythonic: Pure Python, no config languages
- Composable: Mix and match components
- Production-ready: From day one

### Phase 2 Vision
Transform VibePiper from v0.2.0 (foundation) to v0.3.0 (capable framework):
- **Before**: Can define assets but can't connect to real data
- **After**: Full integration layer + transformations + CLI

### Risk Mitigation
Identified high-risk items:
- vp-f557 (Transformation Framework) - High complexity
- vp-0862 (Database Connectors) - Many databases
- vp-2e59 (CLI) - New interface, UX challenges

Documented mitigation strategies for each.

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Review and approve Phase 2 roadmap
2. Review and prioritize the 12 generated tickets
3. Set up sprint planning for Phase 2
4. Kick off vp-0862 (Database Connectors) as first ticket

### Phase 2 Execution
- Week 1-2: Integration Layer (vp-0862, vp-77b7, vp-045b)
- Week 3: Transformations (vp-f557, vp-1aa6)
- Week 4: Developer Experience (vp-2e59, vp-6ce9, vp-02cc)
- Week 5-6: Polish & Examples (vp-48c5, vp-e2b5)

### Post-Phase 2 Preview
Phase 3 will focus on:
- Scheduling & Orchestration
- Web UI for monitoring
- Advanced features (distributed execution)

## Technical Brief

### Integration Layer Design
Protocol-based connectors with type-safe result mapping:
```python
class DatabaseConnector(Protocol):
    def connect(self) -> Connection
    def query(self, sql: str, params: dict) -> DataFrame
    def disconnect(self) -> None
```

### Transformation Framework
Python-first with SQL as first-class citizen:
```python
# Python transformation
@transform
def customer_orders(customers, orders):
    return join(customers, orders, on="customer_id", how="left")

# SQL transformation
@sql_asset(dialect="postgresql")
def clean_customers():
    return "SELECT id, LOWER(email) FROM raw_customers"
```

### CLI Design
Typer-based CLI with TOML configuration:
```bash
vibepiper init my-pipeline --template=etl
vibepiper run my-pipeline/ --asset=customers --env=prod
```

## Risks & Considerations

### Low Risk
- Well-defined scope with clear boundaries
- Dependencies on solid Phase 1 foundation
- Research already completed (Dagster, dbt, etc.)
- Incremental delivery (shippable after each ticket)

### Considerations
- Timeline depends on team size and capacity
- May need to adjust priorities based on user feedback
- Some tickets (vp-f557, vp-0862) may need to be split
- P2 tickets (vp-db50, vp-141f) are optional and can be deferred

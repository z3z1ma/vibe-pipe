# Fix LOOM_ROADMAP merge artifact + refresh backlog

## Context
- `LOOM_ROADMAP.md` currently contains a merge-conflict artifact line: `||||||| 7a7535a`.
- The roadmap backlog block appears stale (e.g., lists `vp-b2ef` as backlog even though the ticket is `closed`).

This breaks our planning signal (roadmap is the primary backlog surface).

## Objective
Remove merge artifacts from LOOM docs and refresh the derived roadmap backlog so it matches current ticket state.

## Scope
- Remove any conflict markers/artifacts from:
  - `LOOM_ROADMAP.md`
  - (quick scan) other `LOOM_*.md`
- Refresh the roadmap backlog block (use `compound_sync` if applicable).
- Ensure the roadmap backlog matches actual open/in-progress tickets.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] No conflict markers exist in `LOOM_*.md` (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`, `|||||||`).
- [ ] `LOOM_ROADMAP.md` backlog block does not list closed tickets.
- [ ] Backlog block includes at least the current open + in_progress tickets from:
  - `loom ticket list --status open`
  - `loom ticket list --status in_progress`
- [ ] Any derived/index docs are refreshed (run `compound_sync` if it is the canonical mechanism).

## Dependencies
- None.

## Suggested Order
Do this early in the sprint; it unblocks accurate planning for all other work.

## Recon Notes
- Evidence: `grep -n "\\|\\|\\|\\|\\|\\|\\|" LOOM_ROADMAP.md` returns a match.
- Evidence: `loom ticket show vp-b2ef` shows status `closed`.

## Notes

**2026-01-31T17:50:21Z**

Starting work: remove LOOM_* conflict artifacts and refresh LOOM_ROADMAP backlog block.

**2026-01-31T17:51:52Z**

Fixed LOOM_ROADMAP.md merge artifact (removed stray '||||||| 7a7535a' + duplicate END/notes) and updated roadmap-backlog block to match current open/in_progress tickets (from 'loom ticket list'). Next: run compound_sync to refresh derived blocks/indexes, then verify no conflict markers remain and commit.

**2026-01-31T17:52:11Z**

Committed LOOM_ROADMAP cleanup/backlog refresh: 291653f.

**2026-01-31T17:52:55Z**

Removed stale/closed ticket references from roadmap backlog text (dropped deps annotations that mentioned closed tickets) and committed: b4b810d. Ran compound_sync; no further changes. Verified no conflict markers in LOOM_*.md.

**2026-01-31T17:55:22Z**

Manager review: APPROVED. Enqueued to merge queue (wait) as item a459e5ecd3 from worker w4, branch team/vp-a511.

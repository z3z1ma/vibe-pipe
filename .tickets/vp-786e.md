# Align asset creation paths (decorators vs builder)

Objective
Make asset creation consistent across decorators and PipelineBuilder to improve cohesion and avoid divergent behavior.

Dependencies
- vp-ba4d (Core abstraction contract).
- vp-a1f7 (Consolidated PipelineContext/types).

Suggested Order
1. After vp-ba4d and vp-a1f7.

Notes
- `PipelineBuilder.asset` and `@asset` decorator have overlapping logic and should converge.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Asset creation uses a single shared helper or factory path.
- `PipelineBuilder.asset` no longer double-creates operators and uses the canonical config rules.
- Decorator + builder behave consistently for metadata, config, materialization, io_manager, cache/parallel/lazy.
- Tests cover builder and decorator parity for common cases.

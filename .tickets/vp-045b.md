# API Clients

Build API client helpers for common APIs (REST, GraphQL, webhook) to enable data ingestion from external sources.

## Tasks
1. Create APIClient base class
2. Implement REST client with retry logic
3. Implement GraphQL client
4. Add authentication helpers (API key, OAuth, Bearer token)
5. Add rate limiting and backoff
6. Add webhook handler for receiving data
7. Add pagination support
8. Add response parsing and validation

## Dependencies
- vp-103 (Validation framework)

## Technical Notes
- Use httpx or aiohttp for async support
- Implement exponential backoff for retries
- Handle 429 (rate limit) responses gracefully
- Validate responses against schemas

## Acceptance Criteria

REST client works with common APIs
GraphQL client for APIs with GraphQL
Multiple auth methods supported (API key, OAuth, Bearer)
Rate limiting prevents throttling
Webhook handler can receive data
Pagination handled automatically
Tests with mock servers
Documentation and examples
Test coverage > 85%

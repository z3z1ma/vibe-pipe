# Asset Versioning & Lineage

Add asset versioning and automatic lineage tracking for data governance.

## Tasks

- Add version field to assets
- Track lineage (upstream dependencies) in execution results
- Store asset metadata (created_at, updated_at, checksum)
- Add lineage query API
- Visualize lineage as Mermaid DAG

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Assets have version numbers
- [ ] Lineage tracked automatically
- [ ] Can query upstream/downstream assets
- [ ] Can export lineage as Mermaid diagram
- [ ] Metadata stored with materialized assets
- [ ] API for querying lineage

## Deliverables

- Lineage tracking in execution engine
- Lineage query API
- Mermaid export function
- Tests

**Priority:** P1 (High)
**Estimate:** 3 days
**Dependencies:** VP-100

## Notes

**2026-01-28T00:09:42Z**

Implementation complete. All acceptance criteria met:
- Assets have version numbers ✓ (already in Asset type)
- Lineage tracked automatically ✓ (lineage field in AssetResult)
- Can query upstream/downstream assets ✓ (get_upstream, get_downstream methods)
- Can export lineage as Mermaid diagram ✓ (to_mermaid method)
- Metadata stored with materialized assets ✓ (created_at, updated_at, checksum in AssetResult)
- API for querying lineage ✓ (get_lineage_graph, get_upstream, get_downstream)

Implementation details:
- Added Asset metadata fields: created_at, updated_at, checksum
- Added AssetResult metadata fields: created_at, updated_at, checksum
- Implemented lineage query methods on AssetGraph
- Implemented Mermaid diagram export
- Added calculate_checksum utility function
- Updated DefaultExecutor to populate metadata
- Added comprehensive test suite (25 new tests)

All tests pass (353 passing, 32 pre-existing errors in expectations module)

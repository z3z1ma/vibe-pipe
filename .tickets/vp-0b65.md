# Implement Schema class (type definition)

## Notes

**2026-01-27T08:40:38Z**

Investigation: Schema class already implemented in types.py from vp-530e. All 58 tests passing, 95% coverage. Need to clarify if this ticket is already complete or if there's additional work needed. Found mypy errors in core.py unrelated to Schema.

**2026-01-27T08:44:35Z**

Investigation complete: Schema class fully implemented in vp-530e. All 9 Schema tests passing. Enhanced public API by exporting DataType, AssetType, OperatorType enums to improve UX. Verification:
- Schema class: ✓ implemented (frozen dataclass, validation, get_field, has_field)
- SchemaField: ✓ implemented with full validation
- Type hints: ✓ strict mypy compliance
- Tests: ✓ 9/9 passing
- Documentation: ✓ comprehensive in docs/type_system.md
Improvement made: Exported core enums for better API usability.

# Sprint prep: Config pipelines verification

Deliverable:
- Create/adjust sprint tickets directly (include the sprint tag).
- For each ticket: acceptance criteria, deps, and suggested ordering.
- Propose which tickets can run in parallel.

Sprint name: Config pipelines verification
Sprint tag: sprint:Config-pipelines-verification

## Notes

**2026-01-31T03:35:16Z**

Starting sprint prep reconnaissance for Config pipelines verification: will inventory pipeline config + validation entrypoints, CI coverage, and gaps; will create sprint-tagged tickets with acceptance criteria, deps, ordering, and parallelization guidance.

Anomaly Detection - Statistical Methods

Tasks:
1. Statistical anomaly detection (Z-score, IQR, isolation forest)
2. ML-based anomaly detection (Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM)
3. Configurable sensitivity/thresholds
4. Anomaly scoring and ranking
5. Anomaly detection per asset
6. Historical baseline comparison

Acceptance Criteria:
- Statistical methods working (Z-score, IQR)
- ML methods working (Isolation Forest)
- Configurable thresholds
- Anomaly scoring output
- Integration with @validate decorator
- Tests with synthetic anomalies
- 85%+ coverage
- Documentation

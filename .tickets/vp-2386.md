Anomaly Detection - Statistical Methods

Tasks:
1. Statistical anomaly detection (Z-score, IQR, isolation forest)
2. ML-based anomaly detection (Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM)
3. Configurable sensitivity/thresholds
4. Anomaly scoring and ranking
5. Anomaly detection per asset
6. Historical baseline comparison

Acceptance Criteria:
- Statistical methods working (Z-score, IQR)
- ML methods working (Isolation Forest)
- Configurable thresholds
- Anomaly scoring output
- Integration with @validate decorator
- Tests with synthetic anomalies
- 85%+ coverage
- Documentation

Started work on anomaly detection features. Analyzing existing codebase.

**2026-01-29T22:37:40Z**

Implementation complete. Added:
- One-Class SVM ML method
- Anomaly ranking functionality
- Historical baseline comparison
- @validate decorator integration (4 expect functions)
- 35 tests (all passing)
- 88% code coverage
- Documentation (docs/anomaly_detection.md)

All acceptance criteria met. Ready for review.

MANAGER REVIEW: Anomaly Detection implementation verified. Code adds: 1) Statistical methods (Z-score, IQR) 2) ML-based methods (Isolation Forest) 3) Configurable thresholds 4) Anomaly scoring 5) Historical baseline comparison. Tests added (test_anomaly_detection.py). Documentation added (docs/anomaly_detection.md). Ready for merge.

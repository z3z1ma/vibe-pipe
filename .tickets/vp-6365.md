# Integration with External Quality Tools

Integration with External Quality Tools. Integrate Great Expectations and Soda for unified quality reporting.

Tasks:
1. Great Expectations integration
   - GE task decorator
   - Load GE suites from YAML
   - Execute GE validations
   - Convert GE results to VibePiper format
2. Soda integration
   - Soda check decorator
   - Load Soda checks from YAML
   - Execute Soda checks
   - Convert Soda results to VibePiper format
3. Unified quality reporting
   - Merge results from all quality tools
   - Single quality dashboard
   - Consistent error messages

Dependencies: vp-q01 (Advanced validation)

Acceptance Criteria:
- Great Expectations tests execute via VibePiper (@ge_asset decorator)
- Load GE suites from YAML files
- Convert GE results to VibePiper quality format
- Soda checks execute via VibePiper (@soda_asset decorator)
- Load Soda checks from YAML files
- Convert Soda results to VibePiper quality format
- Unified quality dashboard showing results from all tools
- Consistent error messages and quality scores
- Integration tests with real GE and Soda checks
- Documentation and examples

Example Usage:
# Great Expectations integration
@ge_asset(suite_path="ge_suits/customers.yaml")
def customers():
    return load_customers()

# Soda integration
@soda_asset(checks_path="soda_checks/sales.yaml")
def sales():
    return load_sales()

# Unified quality dashboard shows both results

Technical Notes:
- Use great_expectations Python SDK
- Use soda-core Python SDK
- Create adapter pattern for quality tools
- Map validation results to common schema
- Store results in VibePiper metadata store

## Acceptance Criteria

Great Expectations tests execute via VibePiper (@ge_asset decorator), Load GE suites from YAML files, Convert GE results to VibePiper quality format, Soda checks execute via VibePiper (@soda_asset decorator), Load Soda checks from YAML files, Convert Soda results to VibePiper quality format, Unified quality dashboard showing results from all tools, Consistent error messages and quality scores, Integration tests with real GE and Soda checks, Documentation and examples

## Notes

**2026-01-29T20:52:03Z**

DEPENDENCIES: This ticket depends on vp-q01 (Advanced Validation Framework) for the unified validation format. VP-q01 must be complete with the quality model and validation history tracking before external tool integrations can be built.

Priority: HIGH - Enables users to leverage existing quality tool investments (GE, Soda) while providing unified experience.

# Implement Asset class (data asset representation)

## Notes

**2026-01-27T08:42:39Z**

## Investigation

The Asset class was already fully implemented in vp-530e (commit 1b75d43).

### Current Implementation Status:

✓ **Asset class implemented** in `src/vibe_piper/types.py`
  - Frozen dataclass (immutable)
  - Fields: name, asset_type, uri, schema, description, metadata, config
  - Validation in __post_init__
  - Supports 6 asset types (TABLE, VIEW, FILE, STREAM, API, MEMORY)

✓ **Tests passing**: 6/6 tests in TestAsset class
  - test_create_basic_asset
  - test_asset_with_schema
  - test_asset_with_metadata
  - test_asset_empty_name_raises_error
  - test_asset_empty_uri_raises_error
  - test_asset_is_frozen

✓ **Documentation complete**: docs/type_system.md includes Asset section with examples

✓ **Type safety**: mypy strict mode passes for types.py

✓ **Coverage**: 95% coverage for types.py

### Design Notes:

Asset is a frozen dataclass designed as a data representation/metadata container.
It describes data sources and sinks but does not implement I/O operations itself.
The Source and Sink protocols are meant to be implemented by separate classes
that work with Asset instances.

### Verification Commands:

```bash
# Run Asset tests
uv run pytest tests/test_types.py::TestAsset -v

# Type checking
uv run mypy src/vibe_piper/types.py --strict

# View class
uv run python -c "from vibe_piper import Asset; help(Asset)"
```

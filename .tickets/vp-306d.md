Implementation complete! Execution engine for AssetGraph with full test coverage and linting.

## Summary

Implemented a complete execution engine for executing AssetGraphs with support for:
- ExecutionEngine class with configurable error strategies (FAIL_FAST, CONTINUE, RETRY)
- AssetResult and ExecutionResult types for tracking execution outcomes
- Executor protocol for extensibility
- DefaultExecutor implementation for basic asset execution
- Selective execution (target specific assets + their dependencies)
- Comprehensive metrics tracking (duration, success/failure counts)
- Lineage tracking for data provenance

## Testing

All 117 project tests passing with 85% coverage. All linting checks passing (black, ruff, mypy).

## Commit

Commit 638ca92: feat: implement execution engine for AssetGraph execution

Ready for review.

# Testing Infrastructure Foundation

Build testing infrastructure for pipelines (fixtures, mocks, utilities).

## Tasks

- Create pytest fixtures for common objects (Asset, Pipeline, Context)
- Create mock IO managers for testing
- Create fake data generators
- Create assertion helpers for validation
- Add test patterns documentation
- Create integration test framework

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] 10+ pytest fixtures available
- [ ] Mock IO managers for all types
- [ ] Fake data generators for common schemas
- [ ] Assertion helpers (`assert_valid_asset`, `assert_lineage`, etc.)
- [ ] Integration test framework with database setup
- [ ] Documentation on testing patterns
- [ ] Example tests using the infrastructure

## Deliverables

- `tests/conftest.py` with fixtures
- `tests/fixtures/` with fake data
- `tests/helpers/` with assertion helpers
- Testing documentation

**Priority:** P0 (Blocker)
**Estimate:** 4 days

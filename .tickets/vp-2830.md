Configuration Management. Tasks: 1) Environment-based configs (dev/staging/prod) 2) Secrets management 3) Config validation 4) Config file formats (TOML/YAML/JSON) 5) Config inheritance 6) Runtime config overrides. Acceptance: Multi-environment support, secrets handled, validation working, multiple formats, inheritance, overrides, tests, docs.

**2026-01-29T22:25:37Z**

Analysis complete. Already implemented: env-based configs, secrets management (env/file/vault), config validation, runtime cli_overrides.

Missing features to implement:
1. YAML and JSON format support (currently only TOML)
2. Config inheritance (base/default config pattern)
3. Enhanced runtime overrides (environment-level merging)
4. Tests for new features
5. Documentation

Starting implementation:
- Add pyyaml dependency for YAML support
- Update loader.py to handle YAML/JSON/TOML
- Add config inheritance with base environment
- Add comprehensive tests

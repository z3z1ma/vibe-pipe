# Error Handling & Recovery

Improve error handling with retry logic, checkpointing, and recovery.

## Tasks

- Implement retry decorator for assets
- Add checkpoint support in pipelines
- Implement `ErrorStrategy` behaviors (FAIL_FAST, CONTINUE, RETRY)
- Add error context (stack traces, inputs)
- Implement recovery from checkpoints

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Retry decorator works with exponential backoff
- [ ] Checkpoints save state to IO manager
- [ ] Recovery resumes from last checkpoint
- [ ] Error context captured and logged
- [ ] All error strategies work correctly
- [ ] Tests for error scenarios

## Example Usage

```python
@asset(retries=3, backoff="exponential")
def flaky_api_call():
    return fetch_data()
```

## Deliverables

- Retry logic in decorators
- Checkpoint system in execution engine
- Error handling utilities
- Tests

**Priority:** P1 (High)
**Estimate:** 3 days
**Dependencies:** VP-101

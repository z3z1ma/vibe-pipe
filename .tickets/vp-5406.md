# Set up test infrastructure and CI/CD pipeline

Phase 0: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
Dependencies: vp-2ceb

Configure pytest with coverage reporting, set up GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline, add test data fixtures (sample CSV, Parquet, JSON), configure test coverage thresholds (>90%), set up automated testing on PR.

TDD approach: test infrastructure first.

Acceptance Criteria:
- pytest runs successfully
- Coverage report generated
- CI/CD pipeline passes
- Test fixtures load correctly
- Coverage threshold enforced

Priority: P0 (blocking for all other work)
Estimate: 3 points
Phase: 0

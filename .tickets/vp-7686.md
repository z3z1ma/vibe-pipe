# Sprint prep: Bootstrap backlog + objective

Objective:
Bootstrap this run: investigate repo state and propose next concrete objective + ordered ticket set (with deps) for execution.

Deliverable:
- Create/adjust sprint tickets directly (include the sprint tag).
- For each ticket: acceptance criteria, deps, and suggested ordering.
- Propose which tickets can run in parallel.

Sprint name: Bootstrap backlog + objective
Sprint tag: sprint:Bootstrap-backlog-objective

## Notes

**2026-01-31T17:45:55Z**

Progress update (investigation):

- Repo state: clean working tree; only 2 open tickets repo-wide before sprint tagging (vp-98cc, vp-0429).
- Found roadmap hygiene issue: `LOOM_ROADMAP.md` contains merge artifact `||||||| 7a7535a` and backlog block is stale (e.g. lists closed vp-b2ef).

Proposed sprint objective (rev 1):
Ship schema-first field mapping end-to-end (SchemaField.source_path + conversions) and propagate consistent source_path parsing (dot + bracket) into config-driven pipelines and the transformation library; in parallel land the already-in-progress public API/docs alignment and add snapshot testing as regression protection.

Tickets created/updated (all tagged sprint:Bootstrap-backlog-objective):
- Created: vp-a511 (Fix LOOM_ROADMAP merge artifact + refresh backlog)
- Created: vp-36be (Adopt schema-first source_path parsing in config + transforms) [deps: vp-f701]
- Updated: vp-98cc (tag + priority; note: already in_progress with docs changes + ready-for-review message in ticket)
- Updated: vp-0429 (tag)

Suggested ordering + concurrency:
1) vp-a511 (P1) - do first; unblocks accurate planning signal. Can run in parallel with everything else.
2) vp-98cc (P1, in_progress) - manager review + merge when ready. Parallel.
3) vp-f701 (P1, in_progress) - finish schema-first mapping core.
4) vp-36be (P1, deps vp-f701) - refactor pipeline_config + transformations to support bracket syntax via shared parser.
5) vp-0429 (P2) - snapshot testing; fully parallel/optional.

INVESTIGATOR_DONE

Objective (proposed):
Ship schema-first field mapping end-to-end (SchemaField.source_path + conversions) and propagate consistent source_path parsing (dot + bracket) into config-driven pipelines and the transformation library; in parallel land the public API/docs alignment and optionally add snapshot testing as regression protection.

Sprint ticket set (tagged sprint:Bootstrap-backlog-objective), ordered + deps:
1) vp-a511 (P1) Fix LOOM_ROADMAP merge artifact + refresh backlog
   - No deps; do first; unblocks accurate planning signal.
2) vp-98cc (P1, in_progress) Public API + docs alignment for core abstractions
   - Deps satisfied (vp-786e/vp-a1f7/vp-b2ef all closed); ticket notes indicate docs work already done + ready for review.
3) vp-f701 (P1, in_progress) Schema-first mapping (source_path + conversions)
   - Core capability needed for downstream usage.
4) vp-36be (P1) Adopt schema-first source_path parsing in config + transforms
   - Deps: vp-f701.
5) vp-0429 (P2) Snapshot testing framework
   - No deps; fully parallel; nice-to-have.

Concurrency:
- Can run in parallel: vp-a511, vp-98cc, vp-0429
- Gated by vp-f701: vp-36be

Ticket ops performed:
- Created: vp-a511, vp-36be
- Updated (tags/priority only): vp-98cc, vp-0429, vp-f701

Completed implementation of core type system and interfaces.

Core Types Implemented:
- Asset: Data sources/sinks with schemas and metadata
- Schema: Data structure with fields, types, and constraints
- SchemaField: Individual field definitions with validation
- Pipeline: Composable DAG of operators
- Operator: Transformation operations with type hints
- DataRecord: Schema-validated data records
- PipelineContext: Execution context with config and state

Protocols Defined:
- Validatable, Transformable, Executable
- Source, Sink, Observable

Type Aliases:
- JSONPrimitive, JSONValue, RecordData
- Timestamp, OperatorFn

Acceptance Criteria Met:
- mypy strict mode passes (0 errors)
- 57 unit tests with 95% coverage
- Documentation in docs/type_system.md
- All types immutable (frozen dataclasses)
- Full type hints throughout

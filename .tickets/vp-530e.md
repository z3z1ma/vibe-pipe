# Define core type system and interfaces

Phase 0: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
Dependencies: vp-2ceb

Define core types: Asset, Schema, Pipeline, Operator. Create type aliases for common patterns. Define protocols (interfaces) for extensibility. Add type hints throughout. Write unit tests for type system.

This is the foundational work for the entire system - get the types right and everything else becomes easier.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Core types defined with type hints
- mypy strict mode passes
- Unit tests for all types
- Documentation for type system

Priority: P0 (blocking for all other work)
Estimate: 4 points
Phase: 0

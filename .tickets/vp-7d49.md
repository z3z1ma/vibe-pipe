## Notes

**2026-01-29T10:16:59Z**

Pipeline Scheduling System. Tasks: 1) Cron-like schedule support 2) Interval-based scheduling 3) Event-driven triggers 4) Schedule persistence 5) Schedule history/audit 6) Backfill support 7) Timezone handling. Acceptance: Cron/interval schedules working, event triggers, schedule persistence, backfills, timezone support, tests, docs, 85% coverage.

**2026-01-29T10:18:03Z**

DEPENDENCIES: Depends on orchestration engine (vp-cf95). Scheduling needs to integrate with the execution engine to schedule pipeline runs. Phase 3 priority: HIGH - after orchestration is working.

# Sprint prep: Config pipelines verification

Objective:
Ship config-driven pipeline support by verifying/fixing vp-8690; clarify or close vp-0429.

Deliverable:
- Create/adjust sprint tickets directly (include the sprint tag).
- For each ticket: acceptance criteria, deps, and suggested ordering.
- Propose which tickets can run in parallel.

Sprint name: Config pipelines verification
Sprint tag: sprint:Config-pipelines-verification

## Notes

**2026-01-31T03:39:02Z**

Marked vp-19e7 in_progress. Retrieved related sprint tickets: vp-8d93 (parser jobs), vp-a340 (generator mapping/nested paths), vp-973a (docs CLI alignment), vp-f423 (duplicate sprint prep?). Next: inspect these tickets + vp-0429 (empty) and refine/merge scope into clear ordered sprint backlog; propose parallelizable work.

**2026-01-31T04:01:16Z**

Updated sprint tickets:
- vp-8d93, vp-a340, vp-973a: added scope, acceptance criteria, dependencies section, and suggested order.
- vp-8690: updated as umbrella, added sprint tag, and added deps on vp-8d93/vp-a340/vp-973a.
- vp-0429: retitled and filled with triage scope + AC; added sprint tag.

Suggested order / parallelism:
- Run vp-8d93, vp-a340, vp-973a in parallel.
- vp-8690 is the final verification pass after those complete.
- vp-0429 triage can run early in parallel.

Created tickets: none.

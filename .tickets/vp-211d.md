# Sprint prep: Phase 1 foundations + config pipelines hardening

Deliverable:
- Create/adjust sprint tickets directly (include the sprint tag).
- For each ticket: acceptance criteria, deps, and suggested ordering.
- Propose which tickets can run in parallel.

Sprint name: Phase 1 foundations + config pipelines hardening
Sprint tag: sprint:Phase-1-foundations-config-pipelines-har

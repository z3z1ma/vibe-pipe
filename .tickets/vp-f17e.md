## Notes

**2026-01-29T10:16:59Z**

Pipeline Monitoring & Observability. Tasks: 1) Metrics collection (execution time, record counts) 2) Logging framework 3) Dashboards/visualization 4) Alerts & notifications 5) Performance profiling 6) Error aggregation 7) Health checks. Acceptance: Metrics collected, logging configured, dashboards working, alerts configured, profiling tools, error tracking, health checks, tests, docs.

DEPENDENCIES: Depends on orchestration engine (vp-cf95). Monitoring tracks pipeline executions. Can implement basic logging immediately, but full observability needs execution framework. Phase 3 priority: MEDIUM - nice to have for production.

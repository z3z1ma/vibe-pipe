Starting implementation of automatic retry with backoff features:\n1. Adding jitter to backoff strategy for thundering herd prevention\n2. Implementing dead letter queue (DLQ) functionality\n3. Adding retry metrics tracking\n4. Implementing circuit breaker pattern

## Notes

**2026-01-29T22:47:27Z**

Implementation complete! All features implemented and committed:

1. ✅ Jitter strategies (NONE, FULL, EQUAL, DECORRELATED) - Added to RetryConfig and retry_with_backoff
2. ✅ Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) - Implemented DeadLetterQueue, DeadLetterItem classes
3. ✅ Circuit Breaker - Implemented CircuitBreaker, CircuitState, CircuitBreakerConfig, CircuitBreakerError
4. ✅ Retry Metrics - Implemented RetryMetrics class with metric conversion

Code changes:
- Enhanced error_handling.py with ~600 new lines of code
- Updated __init__.py to export new classes
- Created test_advanced_retry.py with 30+ tests
- Fixed existing tests to account for jitter

Next steps:
- Format code with ruff
- Run linting and type checking
- Update documentation
- Achieve 85%+ test coverage
